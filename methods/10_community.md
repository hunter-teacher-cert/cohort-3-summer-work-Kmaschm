### Activity: Name Tents with Feedback

#### How It Works
For first day of class:
Students each receive card stock with printing on one side (to be folded inside) and markers.

We talk about the reasoning & directions (below) and how the room should look/sound/feel like when getting materials, working on name tents, and putting materials away.  
> **Reasoning for students**
>
> Why are we making name tents?
We are making name tents so I can learn all of your names quickly AND so that we can communicate a little each day!
>
> What do these name tents look like?
>
> Once folded:
> * Outside - has your name on front AND back
> * Inside - at then of class, write me a short message each day & I will write back!


> **Student directions**
> 1. Fold your name tent in thirds.
>
>2. Write your name on the outside: front AND back!
>
> 3. Show you are done by:
> * placing your name tent at the front of your desk
>
>   AND
> * putting all but 1 of your markers away.

After setting expectations and demoing how to fold & label name tents, students are released one table at a time to grab markers & other writing utensils.  Timer is then set for creating name tents.

Once time limit is reached, students are reminded to return markers/writing utensils.  

Class share out: Name & (optional) 1 thing about yourself

**At the end of class for the first week**
Students are given a menu of prompts and asked to write/draw in their name tent in response to the prompt.

> Sample prompt:
> * Answer the prompt:  What is one thing you’re hoping to learn or do in this class?  (Write or draw your answer!)
> * Comment or Question
> * Suggestion about this class

Teacher responds on each name tent after class, then returns name tents each day.

#### Expected Positive Outcomes
This is attractive because...
* helps teacher learn names
* low-stakes communication
* students share out a bit at the start
* students learn that their teacher is reading and responding to their thinking

#### Rollout Timeline
* First week of school - needs more time first day, then <5 min or so total classtime each day: 1-2 to read over response from teacher at start and 1-2 to respond to prompt at end of class
* Need to set aside time outside of class to respond to all students: can be quick, 15-30 sec responses per student

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
How are students responding each day?
Is the teacher learning names? ;)

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* Need time outside of class to respond to all students: can be quick, 15-30 sec responses per student

### Activity: 1-100 Game

#### How It Works
Have students in groups of 3 or 4 (can do 2 if needed, but not 1 or > 4).
Have sheets printed with 1-100 placed in seemingly random order (see link)

Go over student instructions & have students confirm order amongst themselves (who is 1, 2, etc?)

>**Student instructions**
>You & your table will get a sheet that has the numbers 1-100 on it, but the numbers are not in order.
>
>Your group’s job:  in 3 minutes, mark as many numbers (1-100) as you can IN ORDER.   
>
> Person 1 marks 1, 
> Person 2 marks 2, 
> Person 3 marks 3, …  and so on.  

> You may HELP one another, but each person must mark their own numbers!
