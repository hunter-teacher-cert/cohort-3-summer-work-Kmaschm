# Assignment: Write instructions for [Teacher Name] the Robot

## Overview
Students draw a design of their choosing using a set of specified shapes, then write instructions on how to recreate their image.  Instructions are then explicitly followed, illustrating need for explicit instruction.

Additionally, shapes used are ones covered early in p5.  This will also help students start breaking down designs into these shapes.


## Groupwork approaches/techniques used
* Unplugged activity (may play [1-100 unplugged game](https://www.saravanderwerf.com/100-numbers-to-get-students-talking/) to get students to have a low-stakes, short, but fun activity that requires collaborations!)
* Classroom setup (in heterogeneous groups) -- students have someone nearby to collaborate with, thoughtful intentional, heterogeneous groupings
* Intentional heterogeneous groupings -- having a variety of student experiences and interests will help students learn from each other during this activity
* Individual think time, then group activity -- practice idea, view some examples, then work together as a group


## Instructions
 [Teacher Name] the Robot knows how to draw the following shapes:
* circle
* oval
* square
* rectangle
* triangle
* line

[Have visuals for each shape.  Ask if students have any clarify Qs re shapes.]

What can you draw using ONLY these shapes?  (You can draw as many of each shape as you want, but can only use these shapes.)

#### Individual think time 
Let’s practice: Draw a food using only the shapes above!  Note: don't draw one oval, call it a chicken nuggie, and say you're all done.  (2-3mins)

#### Shareout
After time limit is up, students may choose to present their foods to the class.

#### Instructions for group activity
With your table group:

1. Using ONLY the shapes  [Teacher Name] the Robot knows, draw a SECRET object. It cannot be a food item and MUST be school-appropriate.  Don’t let  [Teacher Name] see it!
2. On chart paper, write instructions of how to draw your SECRET  picture.
3. When you are all done,  [Teacher Name] will try to draw your SECRET drawing only from your instructions.  

[Have student read instructions out loud.  Ask what they will need to do first, then next, then after that, making sure all instructions are clear.]

#### Group work time
* Timer for deciding what to draw (1 min)
* Timer for drawing object (2 min)
* Timer for writing out instructions (5 min)

[During each section, teacher circulates without looking at student papers.  Keeping an eye on group work, teacher may suggest roles for students if needed: getting materials, writing names, alternating writing instructions, talking through instructions, noting what order things need to be drawn in, etc]

#### Presentation of instructions
Each group presents instructions (holding paper, reading instructions) while  [Teacher Name] the Robot follows instructions.  Use of robot voice & movements strongly encouraged!

#### Debrief
* How did this go?  (Students share original drawing. 
 If desired, teacher to note parts or trends that were close to original) 
* What went well?
* Why did we do this?
* What can we do better next time/in the future?


## Intended benefits of groupwork over solo work
Having thought & work partners helps make ideas and instructions better.  This work also lets students use their strengths - a student may be better at coming up with ideas, or drawing, or expressing written instructions, etc.
