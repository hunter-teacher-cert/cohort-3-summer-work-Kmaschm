# Assignment: Write instructions for Kate the Robot

## Overview
Students draw a design of their choosing using a set of specified shapes, then write instructions on how to recreate their image.  Instructions are then explicitly followed, illustrating need for explicit instruction.

Additionally, shapes used are ones covered early in p5.  This will also help students start breaking down designs into these shapes.


## Groupwork approaches/techniques used
* Unplugged activity (may play 1-100 unplugged game to get students to have a low-stakes, short, but fun activity that requires collaborations!)
* Individual think time, then group activity




## Instructions
Kate the Robot knows how to draw the following shapes:
* circle
* oval
* square
* rectangle
* triangle
* line

[Have visuals for each shape.  Ask if students have any clarify Qs re shapes.]

What can you draw using ONLY these shapes?  (You can draw as many of each shape as you want, but can only use these shapes.)

Letâ€™s practice: Draw a food using only the shapes above!  Note: don't draw one oval, call it a chicken nuggie, and say you're all done.

Select a groupwork approach/technique most suitable
Flesh out the "teacher-facing" parts of this assignment to address specifics how the groupwork component will be worked in. Address these, at minimum:



What are the intended benefits of groupwork over solo work?
Mechanisms for gauging how well it is working?
What to do when trouble erupts... (resistance to a grouping, lack of buy-in, "dead-weight" teammates, know-it-alls, etc.)
What instructions/guidance will students get re: the groupwork mechanics?
What long-term or class-wide goals does this support, and how?
