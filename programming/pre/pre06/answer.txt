Exercise 1:

1. Draw a table that shows the value of the variables i and n during the execution of loop. The table should contain one column for each variable and one line for each iteration.

n  | i
--------
10 | 10
10 | 5
10 | 6
10 | 3
10 | 4
10 | 2
10 | 1


2. What is the output of this program?

10
5
6
3
3
4
2

3. Can you prove that this loop terminates for any positive value of n?

Positive integer value of n?  Yes.  

If n <= 1, the loop terminates.

If n is even, the value decreases by n/2.
If n is odd, the value increments by 1, making the value even and then decrementing. This means it'll take 2 steps, but n will decrease by (n+1)/2

THe only time we could get in a loop is if n/2 or (n+1)/2 were less than or equal to 1.

n/2 <= 1 when n <= 2.  If n == 2, it's even and we divide by 2.  n becomes 1 and we are done.

(n+1)/2 <= 1 when n <= 1.
